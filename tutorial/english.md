# GeoFS LiverySelector User Manual
Hello, and welcome to the GeoFS LiverySelector Addon! Before continuing, please read the following to ensure a smooth experience with the addon.

Once you have launched GeoFS with the appropriate code installed, you will see the <img width="15" height="30" alt="logosmall" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RYANAIR5719/GEOFS-LiverySelector/refs/heads/main/logosmall.png" /> button at the bottom, to the right of the **Aircraft** menu. This is where you can access the add-on.

A few icons will also pop up in the aircraft selection menu...
* A <img width="15" height="30" alt="logosmall" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RYANAIR5719/GEOFS-LiverySelector/refs/heads/main/logosmall.png" /> icon mean the aircraft is supported by the add-on.
* A 🎮 means that the aircraft is multiplayer compatible (others can see the liveries if they have the addon, and so can you).
* A 🥇, 🥈, or 🥉 next to a livery means that it had won a livery competition in the past.

Now, on to the important stuff!

## Interface
Once you click on that <img width="15" height="30" alt="logosmall" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RYANAIR5719/GEOFS-LiverySelector/refs/heads/main/logosmall.png" /> button, an interface should (hopefully) pop up. This may take a while for some aircraft due to the immense amount of liveries avaliable for some aircraft, such as the 737s, the A320s, and the 777-300ER.

There is a **search bar** near the top of the for **looking up liveries**, or if you are using **Potato Mode**.

### Favorite Liveries
This section is wwhere all of your starred liveries will pop up. To star a livery, simply click on the little star outline next to it, and it should appear in this section for as long as you don't clear your cache...

### Avaliable Liveries
This is where you can find all the liveries for the aircraft type. For each livery, its information is devided into two lines, one with its name, and the other with the name of its creator. For official aircraft released by Xavier, you can also find a little illustration next to its information of how it looks.

> [!NOTE]
> Some liveries do not have a creator listed because it was entered into the system before the addition of that feature.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have enabled **potato mode**, please use the **search bar** instead to browse the liveries.

### Load External Liveries
This section allows you to upload your experimental liveries for testing before submission, or just your ordinary virtual airline livery. You can see four different tabs in this section...
* **Upload**: This is where you can uplaod your liveries to ImgBB and submit it for review, although you do have to do some setup in the **API** tab. Yoou can also use the form here to upload a livery from a URL.
* **Direct**: This is where you can test your livery by directly uploading it from your files.

【关于竞赛】
您可以在discord或者GitHub参加。
常见问题：
1.为什么我的界面只有三行英文没有显示任何的涂装？
大部分是网速问题，解决方法可以是提升网速或者使用VPN。
2.怎么为LiverySelector制作涂装？
①通过GitHub；
②通过API功能；
③通过Discord；
④通过邮箱上传（必须标明涂装名称+制作者网名，没加的将不会在插件中显示或者不会被上传）。
3.每次进游戏都要重新导入代码，太麻烦了，有没有什么方法不用每次导入？
用插件Tampermonkey（篡改猴）大部分是浏览器插件。安装好后无需每次导入。
4.为什么我点了一个涂装等了好久还不显示？
①有些涂装（例如彩绘）的文件较大，您需要等待一段时间；
②或者您的网速过慢，过等一会会加载出来。
我们的邮箱：LiverySelector20220816@gmail.com（我们通常会在周末查看邮箱，小概率会在工作日），欢迎您为我们提出任何建议、询问问题和提交您的涂装！
