Hello, and welcome to the GeoFS LiverySelector Addon! Before continuing, please read the following to ensure a smooth experience with the addon.

Once you have launched GeoFS with the appropriate code installed, you will see the <img width="15" height="30" alt="logosmall" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolos/GEOFS-LiverySelector/refs/heads/main/logosmall.png" /> button at the bottom, to the right of the **Aircraft** menu. This is where you can access the add-on.

A few icons will also pop up in the aircraft selection menu...
* A <img width="15" height="30" alt="logosmall" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolos26/GEOFS-LiverySelector/refs/heads/main/logosmall.png" /> icon mean the aircraft is supported by the add-on.
* A 🎮 means that the aircraft is multiplayer compatible (others can see the liveries if they have the addon, and so can you).
* A 🥇, 🥈, or 🥉 next to a livery means that it had won a livery competition in the past.

Now, on to the important stuff!

## Interface
Once you click on that <img width="15" height="30" alt="logosmall" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolos26/GEOFS-LiverySelector/refs/heads/main/logosmall.png" /> button, an interface should (hopefully) pop up. This may take a while for some aircraft due to the immense amount of liveries avaliable for some aircraft, such as the 737s, the A320s, and the 777-300ER.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must install the latest version of the code or it won't work!

There is a **search bar** near the top of the for **looking up liveries**, or if you are using **Potato Mode**.

### Favorite Liveries
This section is wwhere all of your starred liveries will pop up. To star a livery, simply click on the little star outline next to it, and it should appear in this section for as long as you don't clear your cache...

### Avaliable Liveries
This is where you can find all the liveries for the aircraft type. For each livery, its information is devided into two lines, one with its name, and the other with the name of its creator. For official aircraft released by Xavier, you can also find a little illustration next to its information of how it looks.

> [!NOTE]
> Some liveries do not have a creator listed due to being entered into the databse before the crediting feature.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have enabled **potato mode**, please use the **search bar** instead to browse the liveries.

### Load External Liveries
This section allows you to upload your liveries for testing before submission, or just your ordinary virtual airline livery. You can see four different tabs in this section...
* **Upload**: This is where you can uplaod your liveries to ImgBB and submit it for review, although you do have to do some setup in the **API** tab. Yoou can also use the form here to upload a livery from a URL.
