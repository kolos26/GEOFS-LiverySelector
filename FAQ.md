## My add-on is not working; how do I fix it?
There are a few reasons why this might have happened:
- The versiion of the addon installed is not the latest one.
- Your internet speed is slow. (in that casee you can just wait a little longer)

Please check to ensure that you have the latest version of the add-on installed, and have a rreliable internet connection.

## I cannot load the liveries of some aircraft; how do I fix this?
Some aircraft (such as the 737s and A320s) have over 100 separate livery files. These can vary from 500 kilobytes to up to a dozen megabytes. It may take up to 30 seconds to load the liveries for some aircraft types for low-end users with unreliable internet connection.

To solve this issue on low-end devices, yoou can enable the Potato Mode just beneath the search bar, which allows higher performance.

>[!NOTE]
>Potato Mode does require you to manually search for the livery at the search bar to browse for liveries.

## How do I contribute liveries to the add-on?
See the [GeoFS LiverySelector User Manuals](https://github.com/kolos26/GEOFS-LiverySelector/tree/main/tutorial).
